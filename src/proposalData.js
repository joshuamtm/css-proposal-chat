    },
    {
      questions: ["Why 12 months?", "Why do you need oversight for so long?", "Why continuous management?"],
      answer: "Continuous oversight is essential because AI projects in sensitive domains like public benefits require sustained management. Early phases focus on requirements and vendor coordination, while later phases shift to testing, compliance, and launch preparation. Dropping oversight too soon is a common failure point that can lead to costly rework.",
